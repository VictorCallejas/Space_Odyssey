## Summary

Hal is an assistant that informs and notifies you about rocket launches, help you with your space questions and also capable of creating art!

If there is something he does not know, do not worry, he learn fast.

With an self-scalable architecture, that allows him to scale up when there is a lot of demand so he can provide the best service and scale down when not so he can save resources and infrastructure cost, this is essential in any global and a sustainable solution.

## Hal

In the last decades many companies have appeared in the space sector and the space launches have multiplied so to be aware of all the launches is not easy, hence the concept of space odyssey.

Currently there are many proposals such as websites or apps, but we wanted a solution that would encourage the user to see the launch, that was not the user who has to be pending and looking, but had something that would be proposed and facilitated, so more comfortable and saving time.

The reference to HAL9000 also has a meaning, and as the evolution in the movie, at first it seems only a chatbot, then you will think that it is an assistant and finally you will not know how to fit it into any specific side.

We do not either, so we call him Hal.

Let's see first its chatbot function.

The first time we talk with him we will make a brief questionnaire to better fit each person. This configuration can be changed whenever you want, simply by saying "change configuration". This is one of the best features of Hal does not need to say a specific phrase, but offers us an interaction as if it were a person, we could say "set settings" and also understand us.

In case you do not understand why you have used very different words, Hal will respond that you have not understood it (Fallback intent) and the developers will see this phrase so that you will be trained so that next time you understand it, if desired .

Users can ask questions for which they have not been programmed to respond, in this case the developers will also see it in a way that they can teach. Let's give an example:

User: What astronaut has more time in space?
Hal: I'm sorry I did not understand you, but calm that I learn fast!

Here the developers can decide if to teach him to answer that question and send a notification to the user with the answer. When any other user asks this question he will know how to answer it.

The more he interacts with Hal, the better he recognizes the sentences and when new questions are asked he has the opportunity to learn so that he can respond to anyone later.

Let see some examples of what you can ask Hal now:

| We can ask him for the next launch or for the next launch of a specific agency, he will tell us  date, location, agency, summary, image and a link for more information and streaming(if available)| We can ask him for lots of public agencies and private companies, he will answer us with a summary, logo and a link for more information  | We can ask him for the ISS, he will tell us his velocity and altitude and send us a map with his current position. We can track the ISS |


But why we say that Hal is more than a chatbot, that it is an assistant.

Well, we can ask questions to Hal but will be him, the one that is waiting for us. No need to talk to him. He will be able to send us notifications before a launch occurs for example, these notifications can be configured.

The creators are enthusiasts of space exploration, so we decided to add the challenge of 'Artify the earth', to create art and to inspire others. We are many who love the photos of the libraries of NASA, so much that we put them on wallpaper. Well, better than those photos had a personal touch.

For this we will tell Hal that we need inspiration or that he believes us a piece of art. He will ask us for a photo and a spatial style, which has to do with photos from the libraries of NASA.

Let's see some examples:
