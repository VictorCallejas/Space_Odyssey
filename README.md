## Summary

Hal is an assistant that **informs** and **notifies** you about rocket launches. It can also help you with your **space questions** and even **create art!**

If he doesn't know something, don't worry,  **he learns** fast. 

It's designed with a **self-scalable architecture**. This architecture allows him to scale up when there is a lot of demand, so the service isn't compromised. But also lets him scale down when the demand decreases so he can save resources and infrastructure cost. This is essential in any **global and sustainable solution**.

## Hal

In the last decades, many companies have appeared in the space industry and the space launches have multiplied, so it is not easy to be aware of all lift offs, hence the concept of space odyssey.

Currently there are many proposals such as websites or apps, but we wanted a solution that could encourage the user to see the launch. In this platform, the user does not have to be focusing or searching for information. Instead of that, Hal makes everything easier, so it is more comfortable and it is a saving-time tool.

The reference to HAL9000 also has a meaning. Hal evolves in the same way as in the movie. First, it seems only a chatbot, then you will think that it is an assistant and finally you will not know where to fit it.

We neither, so we call him Hal.

#### Chatbot

Let's see first its chatbot function.

In our first conversation with Hal, we will fill a brief questionnaire to stablish our preferences. This configuration can be changed whenever we want, simply by typing "change configuration". This is one of the best features of Hal. We do not have to type a specific sentence, it interacts with us as if it was human. We could say "set settings" and it would understand us too.

In case he does not understand you, because you have used very different words, Hal will respond "I did not understand that" (Fallback intent). The developers will see this sentence, so he can be trained and the next time he will understand you.

Users can ask questions for which Hal has not been programmed to respond. In this case the developers will also see it, and they can program to respond that question. Let's give an example:

User: What astronaut has been more time in space?
Hal: I'm sorry I did not understand you, but do not worry I learn fast!

Here the developers can teach him to answer that question and send a notification to the user with the answer. When any other user asks this question again, he will know how to answer it.

The more people interacts with Hal, the better he recognizes the sentences. When new questions are asked, he has the opportunity to learn. Hal can answer any question that he have learned in any conversation.

Let see some examples of what you can ask Hal now:

| We can ask him for the next launch or for the next launch of a specific agency, he will tell us  date, location, agency, summary, image and a link for more information and streaming(if available).| We can ask him for lots of public agencies and private companies, he will answer us with a summary, logo and a link for more information.  | We can ask him for the ISS, he will tell us his velocity and altitude and send us a map with his current position. We can track the ISS. |

We invite you to try these features.

#### Assistant

But Hal is much more than a chatbot. He is an assistant.

We can ask questions to Hal, but **he will not be waiting for us**. We can configure launch notifications, so he will remind us the next launch some minutes before.

#### Inspire

The creators are enthusiasts of space exploration, so we decided to add the challenge 'Artify the earth'. Hal can **create art to inspire others**. Many people love the pictures of NASA's libraries and many people use them as wallpaper. Well, Hal can add a **personal touch** to this pictures.

To use this function, we can ask for inspiration. He will request a picture and a space style. Space styles are photos from the libraries of NASA.

Let's see some examples:

#### Architecture

While we were designing Hal, we tried to make him available on a **global scale** and **sustainable in the future**.

Architecture scheme:

<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hal-kkxfot.appspot.com/o/arquitectura.png?alt=media&token=2ed21ac7-6e87-4f40-8dec-178d59c9b250" width="1000"/>  


Dialogflow is the chatbot's core. We have chosen this platform for these reasons:
* Easy deploy on **more than 9 platforms**
* Support for **multiple languages**
* Simple integration with other Google services
* **Effective NPL** (Natural Language Processing) recognition of intents and parameters

As we have seen, not everything is question and answer. All the data in real time, updates, deepart... it is thanks to the backend.

The chatbot's fulfillment is responsible for collecting data in real time. For example, the location of the ISS or the databases deployed in the new Firebase service, Firestore. This code is written in Javascript and running on Node js, in several servers offered by Google Compuete Engine that have an elastic load balancer to distribute the requests. These servers are in a horizontal **autoscaling** group. This means, if the number of requests increase, it will create automatically new instances to offer a **quality service without interruptions**. If the number of requests decreases, so does the number of instances to **save resources** and **infrastructure cost**.

Also in Google Compute Engine is a single non-scalable instance responsible for the processing of images with Deepart techniques (Deeplearning). It has an Nvidia Tesla K80 graphics to perform this function.

#### Future

As we have seen, the architecture allows the application to be prepared for a **global deployment in a sustainable way**.

With Dialogflow Hal can understand **multiple languages**. Currently implemented in English, it will soon be implemented in Spanish and German. In the future it will be implemented in Chinese and Russian.

Hal is already available on Telegram, very soon it will be **multi platform**, being available on Facebook messenger. In future it will be implemented on Slack, Google assistant, Line, Alexa and Cortana.

We have disable notifications to improve them, but in the configuration process your chat_id and preferences are stored in users database. So when we activate them, they will be automatically ready for you. We are currently developing the API for the deepart feature and we are importing and integrating an astronauts database. Soon you will be able to ask for any astronaut in history and get information about him.

We strongly believe in this project because his almost **null infrastructure and maintenance costs**. When developers create new features, they are **available globally, for everyone in a sustainable way**.
